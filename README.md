# Phone number validator and dialer

(As part of CS 478 - Software Development for Mobile Platforms)

Android app that allows users to validate phone numbers in two accepted formats. It uses intent extras to pass the validated number from the second activity to the first activity, where the user can then choose to dial the number in the pre-installed Phone app or receive a toast message with the invalid number. The app also handles device configuration changes and remembers the entered number. Overall, the app provides a user-friendly way to validate and dial phone numbers on Android devices using intents.
